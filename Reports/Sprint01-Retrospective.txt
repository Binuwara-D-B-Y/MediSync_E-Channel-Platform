Sprint 01 Retrospective
======================

Summary:
--------
Sprint 01 focused on core patient account management and doctor search features. The team delivered registration, login, password reset, profile management, and basic doctor search/filtering. Most acceptance criteria were met, with some remaining work on doctor availability filtering.

What Went Well:
---------------
- Registration, login, and password reset flows were implemented and tested.
- Profile management allows patients to update key details.
- Doctor search by specialization and name is functional.
- Most acceptance criteria for account and search features were achieved.
- Team collaborated well and delivered on planned stories.

What Could Be Improved:
-----------------------
- Doctor availability filtering (date/slots) is not fully complete (E02.S02.A02.01).
- Some edge cases in validation and error handling need more coverage.
- More automated tests for UI and backend integration would increase confidence.
- User feedback on profile and search UX could be gathered earlier.

Action Items for Next Sprint:
----------------------------
- Complete doctor availability filtering and booking slot logic.
- Add more automated tests (unit, integration, UI).
- Review and improve error handling and validation.
- Gather user feedback on new features and iterate on UX.

Overall, Sprint 01 delivered the foundation for patient management and doctor search. The team should focus next on completing booking features and improving quality/coverage.
